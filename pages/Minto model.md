- Remifentanil plasma concentrations (ng.ml-1) achieved at steady state, estimated by the Minto model in a 70 kg, 170 cm, 40-yr old male patient for various fixed infusion rates.
	- In older patients, the plasma concentration resulting from a given infusion rate is higher, whilst in children it is lower.
