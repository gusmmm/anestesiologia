- [[Electroencephalogram]] (EEG)–based indices are used to track the level of unconsciousness of
  patients receiving general anesthesia.
	- The most commonly used EEG-based indices are the
		- [[bispectral index]] (BIS)
		- the [[Patient Safety Index]] (PSI)
		- [[Narcotrend]]
		- and [[Entropy]]
- Real-time analysis of the [[unprocessed EEG]] and the [[spectrogram]] (density spectral array) is a highly
  informative way to monitor the level of unconsciousness of patients receiving general anesthesia.
