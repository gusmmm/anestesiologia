- simplest model
- Compartment volumes are scaled to [[body weight]] only, and rate constants are Ô¨Åxed
- ((65ce398c-7bc1-4540-a6ce-2c089bbf1f74))
	- the original used no ke0
		- it was used in the diprifusor
		- only offers plasma targeting
	- later versions uses ke0 = 0.26 min-1
		- displays estimated effect-site concentration
	- [[open TCI]] pumps with Marsh effect-site targeting use a ke0 = 1.2 min-1
		- to avoid large loading doses
