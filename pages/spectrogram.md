- The spectrum of a segment of EEG is the decomposition of the EEG signal into its power content by frequency.
- Power is typically expressed in decibels which is 10 times the base 10 logarithm of the square of the amplitude of a given frequency component.
- When the spectrum is computed on successive nonoverlapping or overlapping segments of EEG data, it is termed the spectrogram
- it is called the [[compressed spectral array]] when the spectrogram is plotted in three dimensions and the
  [[density spectral array]] when it is plotted in two dimensions
